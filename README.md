## Data sources

I used the Finnish municipalities TopoJSON made by GitHub user lucified (<https://github.com/lucified/finland-municipalities-topojson>), and converted it into GeoJSON.

For the loan statistics, I used the column "loans / population" ("kokonaislainaus / asukasluku") from [Finnish Library Statistics](https://tilastot.kirjastot.fi/yearlyreports.php).
